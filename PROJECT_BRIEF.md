# AI Agent Service Orchestrator - Project Brief

## Executive Summary
The AI Agent Service Orchestrator is a master control system that manages multiple AI agent services from a unified dashboard. Building on the proven 5-layer architecture from the Reddit Monitor service, this orchestrator will provide centralized monitoring, control, and health management for an entire ecosystem of AI agents.

## Business Context

### Problem Statement
As the number of AI agent services grows, managing them individually becomes increasingly complex:
- **Manual Management**: Starting/stopping services requires terminal access and individual commands
- **Visibility Issues**: No unified view of which services are running, healthy, or errored
- **Scaling Challenge**: Each new service adds operational complexity
- **Recovery Gaps**: When services crash, manual intervention is often required
- **Resource Conflicts**: No coordination between services competing for system resources

### Solution Vision
A single dashboard that provides:
- **Unified Control**: One-click management of all AI agent services
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live status of every service in the ecosystem
- **Automatic Recovery**: Orchestrator ensures failed services restart appropriately
- **Service Discovery**: New agents automatically register with the orchestrator
- **Resource Management**: Coordinate resource usage across all services
- **Operational Intelligence**: Insights into service patterns and performance

### Success Criteria
- **Primary**: All AI agent services manageable from single interface
- **Operational**: Services remain healthy with minimal manual intervention
- **Scalable**: Support for dozens of AI agents without performance degradation
- **Reliable**: Orchestrator itself must be highly available and self-recovering
- **Developer-Friendly**: Easy to add new services to the ecosystem

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Orchestrator Service (Python)
The always-on background service that manages all other services:
- **Service Registry**: Maintains list of all AI agent services and their configurations
- **Health Monitor**: Continuously checks service status and health endpoints
- **Recovery Manager**: Automatically restarts failed services with backoff logic
- **Resource Coordinator**: Manages CPU/memory allocation across services
- **Event Bus**: Publishes service state changes for dashboard consumption
- **Configuration Manager**: Centralized config for all services

#### 2. Web Dashboard (React/Next.js)
Modern, responsive interface for service management:
- **Service Grid**: Visual representation of all services with status indicators
- **Control Panel**: Start/stop/restart buttons for individual and batch operations
- **Health Metrics**: Real-time charts showing service health over time
- **Log Viewer**: Centralized access to service logs with filtering
- **Configuration Editor**: Modify service settings without restarts
- **Alert Center**: Notifications for service failures or anomalies

#### 3. Service Agent SDK (Python Library)
Standardized library for building orchestrator-compatible services:
- **Registration Protocol**: Services announce themselves to orchestrator
- **Health Endpoint**: Standardized health check implementation
- **Metrics Collection**: Performance and operational data reporting
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Clean service termination handling
- **Configuration Integration**: Pull settings from orchestrator
- **Event Publishing**: Send status updates to orchestrator

#### 4. CLI Management Tool
Command-line interface for orchestrator operations:
- **Service Commands**: `orchestrator add`, `remove`, `list`, `status`
- **Bulk Operations**: Manage multiple services simultaneously
- **Configuration Management**: Import/export service configurations
- **Troubleshooting Tools**: Debug commands for service issues
- **Deployment Helpers**: Setup and installation utilities
